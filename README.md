# Arduino_Study_Wind-Chimes
---
### This is a repository for Arduino Programming Language study challenges and capstone project. 
---
#### Challenge Naming Convention: Challenge_#
##### The challenges consisted of a series of scripts that ran on an Arduino attached to a pre-built "Program Test Box." This Program Test Box was lined with various color LEDs and pins for attachment of switches and other peripherals. The challeneges tested the students' Arduino Programming Language knowledge by asking students to manipulate the LEDs using a) a script or b) a combination of script and student-implemented peripherals (i.e. rotary switch).

#### Capstone Name: Let_It_Go_Capstone
##### The capstone project's goal was to build, program, and test a wind-chime machine that could play a song. The song picked for the wind-chime machine was Let It Go by Idina Menzel. The scripts used to run the wind-chime machine were done in the Arduino Programming Language. The mechanical parts (wood, step motors) of the wind-chime machine were designed in CAD and the chimes (hollow aluminum tubes) themselves were designed with the help of Audacity and the Pentatonic Scale method. To play the song, step motors were used to move an assembly to the correct sequence of positions so that the assembly's pneumatic hammer hit the correct chimes to play the song.
