# Arduino_Study_Wind-Chimes

### This is a repository for Arduino Programming Language study project.

##### The study's goal was to build, program, and test a wind-chime machine that could play a song. The song picked for the wind-chime machine was Let It Go by Idina Menzel. The scripts used to run the wind-chime machine were done in the Arduino Programming Language. The mechanical parts (wood, step motor, solenoid) of the wind-chime machine were designed in CAD and the chimes (hollow aluminum tubes) themselves were designed with the help of Audacity and the Pentatonic Scale method. A program test box with LEDs was used to initially test the sketch script prior to implementing the sketch script alongside the mechanical parts. To play the song, step motors were used to move an assembly to the correct sequence of positions so that the assembly's solenoid hit the correct chimes to play the song.
