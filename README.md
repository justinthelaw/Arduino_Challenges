# Let_It_Go_Wind-Chimes

### This is a repository for an Arduino Programming Language study project.

##### The study's goal was to build, program, and test a wind-chime machine that could play a song. The song picked for the wind-chime machine was Let It Go by Idina Menzel. The Arduino sketch used to run the wind-chime machine were done in the Arduino Programming Language. The mechanical portions (wood, hot-glue, nails, hollow aluminum tubes, step motor, solenoid, potentiometer) of the wind-chime machine were designed with PTC Creo, Audacity and the Pentatonic Scale method. A program test box with LEDs was used to initially test the sketch prior to integration with the meachnical assembly. To play the song, step motors were used to move an assembly to the correct sequence of positions so that a solenoid hit the correct chimes.
